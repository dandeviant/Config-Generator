# PROJECT IDEA

Currently facing difficulties writing config for hundreds of 
fuckin ports individually


# Project Overall Objectives
- To automate the process of writing configurations for new switches to be deploued in production level
- Automate the configs that comply to CCC (Config Compliance Check)


# Project Phase Objectives
- Automate the generation of configs for ACCESS PORTS
- To be expanded to global config

## Config Generator 

### Main Idea:

Write a local web app program that generates Cisco IOS config
based on user input


Use basic JavaScript and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (if u want)
No bullshit, just str8 to the point

Planned Features:
1. Same as the current Python console one
2. View unique VLANs input
3. Options to follow CCC standards for each port (snmp trap, all that shit)
